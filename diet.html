        <p>Red pandas belong to the order Carnivora, but this has more to do with their biological classification than their actual diet. In reality they rarely eat meat, instead using their powerful molars to grind through up to four pounds of bamboo a day. They also sometimes eat fruit, acorns, roots, eggs, rodents, and birds.

Like giant pandas, red pandas have an extended wrist bone that functions almost like a thumb and helps them grip bamboo shoots. The solitary creatures forage at night and in the gloaming hours of dusk and dawn.</p>
